Greenland’s fjords and coastal seas support vibrant ecosystems, including vital fish and shellfish stocks that sustain local communities. Physical oceanographic processes shape these ecosystems by controlling nutrient availability and primary production, yet the links between ocean dynamics, biogeochemistry, and ecology remain poorly understood.

To bridge this gap, the NSF-supported project [A Multipronged Approach to Investigate how Hydrography and Mixing Shape Productive Fjord Ecosystems in Greenland](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2335928) employs a combination of targeted field observations and high-resolution coupled ocean-biogeochemistry modeling. Our observations focus on key mixing hotspots—such as fjord sills, glacier fronts, and narrow straits—where physical transport processes influence nutrient dynamics and ecosystem productivity. These data are integrated into a model that captures how ocean circulation, nutrient supply, and biological responses interact over time. By linking physical and ecological processes, we aim to improve predictions of ecosystem shifts, assess the potential impacts of climate change, and provide insights that support sustainable resource management and the resilience of coastal communities in a rapidly changing Arctic.
